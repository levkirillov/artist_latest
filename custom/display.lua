  --[[
  Artist "modules" are functions which take a context as an argument and
  optionally return a value. The context can then be used to require other
  modules (much like Lua's require function).

  Basically it's just a complicated way to avoid having any mutable global
  state, instead we chuck it in a "context" object and pretend it's okay :D:.

  Back on track, in this example, we require two modules:
   - "artist.core.items": Tracks items and inventories in the system.
   - "artist.items.furnaces": Tracks currently connected furnaces.
  ]]
  local items = context:require "artist.core.items"
  local furnaces = context:require "artist.items.furnaces"

  --[[
  The purpose of this module is to draw some statistics to the screen, and we
  define our function to do that here! This draws three stats (and a
  corresponding progress bar):

  - The total number of slots with _any_ item in it.
  - How full these slots are - Basically Î£(item count/max item count).
  - The number of furnaces which are smelting. This is a little slow to update,
    due to the slow polling delay on furnaces.

  Instead of redrawing on a clock, we use Artist's system to subscribe to
  changes and redraw when the inventory system changes instead. However, some
  changes happen in quick succession, and so we add a little debouncing in.

  We do this by starting a timer when a change comes in, then spawning a
  separate task which waits for this timer and redraws.
